		   	<p>In the last year I’ve developed an interest for business practices, professionalism, and success. It’s my job, to a degree, but it’s also a bit of an obsession. I catch myself scrolling through LinkedIn the way that I used to scroll through Instagram.</p>

			<p>My feed is clogged with “drop out” entrepreneur fodder, high-achieving peers advancing in their careers/finishing prestigious graduate programs (go for them!!), and “bootstrap” stories. It’s overwhelming, and I constantly feel as if I’m falling behind. </p>

			<p>As I scroll, I flash back to being a young undergraduate struggling to explain the personal reasons behind my “low GPA”. Being rejected for internship after internship because I didn’t match up with my peers at an institution that frankly, I was not prepared to attend. All of those applications I didn’t finish because they asked for criteria that I KNEW I did not meet, but probably could if given the time. The overwhelming imposter syndrome that kept me up at night, and gave me panic attacks at career fairs. Even today there are times that I look at my lack of certificates and projects and think that I’m. Not. Doing. Enough. </p>

			<p>And I know that if I feel those things - someone that LIVES to work, that is passionate and competent- then there is another undergraduate, or young professional that feels exactly the same way.</p>

			<p>Which is the impetus behind this post. To combat that toxic spiral just a little bit and offer advice to anyone who is stuck in it today. For me, a huge part of being a self aware professional is taking inventory of your fears and doubts, and then creating a game plan for how to move yourself forward. </p>

			<ol>
				<li>Define what success means to YOU, and do not get distracted by trending ideas of success defined by others. </li>
			<li>Find someone that inspires you! If you can, ask them to mentor you.</li>
			<li>Know your worth! If you aren't sure what that is, have serious and honest discussions with yourself, past employers, professors, etc. Assess all of your skills.</li>
			<li>Go for it. It’s uncomfortable, and you’ll doubt yourself along the way. Push past that and keep going. </li>
			<li>Habit stack. If you feel that you could improve your skills (technical or soft), then do that. There are a thousand free ways to pursue your goals. The key is to do it in a sustainable way that makes self-improvement a continuous, lifelong process. </li></ol>

			<p>This is all just to say that while I am not a LinkedIn creator with 15+ years of experience, I get it. And I’ve learned a lot in the past 2 years that I’m more than happy to share with any young professional that feels stunted, lost, or slightly overwhelmed. </p>

			<p>(Sidenote that I do develop sourcing and hiring process for companies, so I have a ~literal~ backend view of this crazy, professional world. Spoiler: You don’t have to meet all of the criteria.) </p>
