    			Mattie is busy. But she can't stop. Blame it on the autism, or the obsessive disorder. 
    			She has an extreme personality and has come to accept it. To ride the wave. 

    			But her degree in Cognitive Science has taught her how to live as healthily as possible, even with this all-or-nothing mentality. It's become easier to control and focus. She's not totally there yet, but with work she hopes to reach her goals. 

    			This is where she channels her energy - extra projects. In an effort to curb the somewhat manic aspects of her disorders, she's sought to channel her burst of energy into continous improvement. Here are the fruits of that labor.
