		                	<p>When I entered college I was determined to become a Chemical Engineer. Not because I was naturally inclined to study it, but because I was told that it was practical. I would be able to find a job anywhere immediately after graduating. Which, when you come from where I do, is probably the most important quality you look for in determining a field of study. </p>

							<p>I pushed down all of my natural abilities and passions, gathered my textbooks, and subscribed to the rigorous and nonmalleable course load. I’ll spare you the gory details and just say that after a few years I left engineering completely.</p> 

							<p>It turned out alright. </p>

							<p>I’m living a better life than either of my parents could have ever imagined, and I’ve still got a whole life ahead of me to continue to build towards my dreams. Yet, although I’ve made it so far, I’m still pressured to do more. When I state that I want to do something, but simply can’t right now it’s insinuated that I don’t care enough, or don’t believe in myself. I’m told to "take risks now while I’m young", and that if my dreams are serious I should push harder for them. I smile and say nothing.</p>

							<p>It makes sense given the world we live in.</p> 

							<p>We’re incessantly bombarded with this new ‘entrepreneurial/dreamer culture’. Hustle culture. A massive explosion of venture capital-backed ideas. You can’t escape anecdotal evidence of people ‘following their dreams’ or ‘taking risks’ and making something of themselves. Creating brands, software, disrupting entire industries. The definition of "success" in itself seems to be becoming alarmingly narrow, to focus almost entirely on those individuals that went out on a limb by dropping out of college, or became Elon Musk-like workhorses These posts too often state that there are no excuses, and if you have a dream and don’t act on it, it’s akin to a personal failure on your part. I mean, if they can do it anyone can. Right?</p>

							<p>And without being a crusher of dreams, the short answer is that no, not everyone can do it. At least not in the bull-like, risk everything manner.</p>

							<p>Our view of what it means to be a success these days rests entirely on a baseline far above the reality of the average person. Have you seen the list of self-made millionaires? There are outliers (Oprah, duh) , but the common characteristic are: male, upper middle-class or above, good high school, good university, family with savings and/or connections, or an exceptional skill that gave them access to college that they would otherwise not have. Our Silicon-wrapped Protestant work ethic has a baseline above the average American, and has HUGE blindspots in regards to race, sex, and economic standing.</p> 

							<p>These are not the ‘American success’ stories that I’m entirely enamored with, and the fact that they have become the impetus for so many dream peddlers on social media to push the dogma of ‘work hard, just do it’ drives me insane. It’s no different than the Anglo-centric doctrines on work ethic of our forefather, or the bootstrapping mentality forced down the throats of impoverished people. </p>

							<p><h4 class='emphasize-text'>For me, this notion that "anyone can do it" is entirely decontextualized and only serves to perpetuate the underlying inequalities.</h4></p> 

							<p>I realize that this could easily be interpreted as someone saying, “Just give up. There’s no point.” That’s not the intention here. As someone that has "defied the odds", I think there’s nothing worse than sitting on a list of obstacles, pouting, and giving up. But I also understand the impact of my relative privileges and how they made it easier/more likely for me to escape than my friends and family.</p>

							<p>Of course you should work hard. Of course you should be passionate about your job, or at the very least find fulfillment in performing well. You should absolutely take ownership of your decisions, and obstacles should never be an excuse to not try. The intention here is to say that it is okay to take calculated risks, and to do so in the context of your reality. It’s absolutely fine if you can’t dive 100% into your dreams right now. <h4 class='emphasize-text'>You are not a failure, or lazy, or lacking passion. You do not have to work yourself to death to self-actualize.</h4></p>

							<p>It turned out alright for me after I gave up engineering, and it wasn’t because I pivoted into my dream major. No, I did a slight left into an equally technically relevant field. I wasn’t keen on wasting all of my maths and science courses, and wasn’t going to waste my golden ticket of a college education on something that wouldn't guarantee me a job. No, I am not living my ultimate dream right now, or following all of my passions. But I am using my degree every day, and have the capacity to build on anything that interests me with much more ease than I did when I was young and poor.</p>

							<p>Do I want to be the CEO of a business (possibly my own) and be a wealthy? Absolutely. Will I get there? Yes. But it won’t be by quitting my job and starting my own company while I have (very) little in savings and no relevant business connections, or a family to fallback on if it all goes South.</p> 

							<p>Reality doesn’t go away. The rules about who represents the American dream will change, but it won’t be by pretending that everyone can do it now with the system that exists.</p> 

							<p>Go out with a plan for the future. Be proud of your progress. Be bold, and brave in your decisions. And don’t get sucked into the latest iteration of America’s favorite pastime - telling underrepresented groups that they’re in their current situation because they aren’t doing enough.</p>

							<p>Most importantly, believe in yourself, your dreams, and your decisions on how you're going to achieve them.</p>
